# Setting Up a Scientific Coding Environment

In this lesson we'll present an overview of setting up
a scientific coding environment that you can use in CoCo
and beyond.

*Primary goals:*

1. Login to a JupyterHub
1. Get familiar with JupyterLab
1. Use a Jupyter Notebook
1. Open a terminal and use basic shell commands

*Stretch goals:*

* Anaconda
* Text editors and integrated development environments (IDEs)


## Topics

1. JupyterHub
1. JupyterLab
1. Jupyter Notebook
1. [Terminal and shell commands](./shell-intro.md)


### Homework

* Make a short Jupyter Notebook that includes Python code and Markdown text
* Read about Jupyter Notebook
* Skim over the Software Carpentry shell lesson

## Resources

* Jupyter Notebook -- https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io
* JupyterLab -- https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io

* The shell lesson is loosely based on the Software Carpentry [shell lesson](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/)
* For more on shell commands, see the [Bash Guide for Beginners](http://www.tldp.org/LDP/Bash-Beginners-Guide/html/) from the Linux Documentation Project and the [GNU Bash Manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/)
