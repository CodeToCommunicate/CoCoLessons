# Setting up a scientific coding environment

In this lesson, we'll set up
an environment for scientific coding that you can use in CoCo
and beyond.

*Goals:*

1. Login to a JupyterHub
1. Get familiar with JupyterLab
1. Use a Jupyter Notebook
1. Open a terminal and use basic shell commands


## Topics

1. [Project Jupyter](./jupyter.md): JupyterHub, JupyterLab, and Jupyter Notebook
1. [The terminal application and shell commands](./shell-intro.md)


## Further reading

See the lists of resources at the end of each of the topics listed above.


## Homework

* Create a short Jupyter Notebook that includes Python code and Markdown text, then run it on the JupyterHub
* Skim over the Software Carpentry shell lesson ([English](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/), [Spanish](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice-es/))

These are open-ended assignments: you can do as much
or as little as you'd like, you will not be graded.
The important thing is to try them;
they're tools that we'll be using throughout CoCo,
so the work you put in now will pay off later!
