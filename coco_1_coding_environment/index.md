# Setting up a scientific coding environment

In this lesson, we'll set up
an environment for scientific coding that you can use in CoCo
and beyond.

*Primary goals:*

1. Login to a JupyterHub
1. Get familiar with JupyterLab
1. Use a Jupyter Notebook
1. Open a terminal and use basic shell commands

*Stretch goals (if we have time):*

* Anaconda and `conda`
* Text editors and integrated development environments (IDEs)


## Topics

1. [Project Jupyter](./jupyter.md): JupyterHub, JupyterLab, and Jupyter Notebook
1. [The terminal application and shell commands](./shell-intro.md)


## Further reading

See the lists of resources at the end of each of the topics listed above.


## Homework

* Create a short Jupyter Notebook that includes Python code and Markdown text, then run it on the JupyterHub
* Skim over the Software Carpentry shell lesson ([English](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/), [Spanish](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice-es/))

These are open-ended assignments--you can do as much
or as little as you'd like; you will not be graded.
The important thing is to try them.
They're tools that we'll be using throughout CoCo,
so the work you put in now will pay off later!
