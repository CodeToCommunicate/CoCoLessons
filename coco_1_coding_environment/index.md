# Setting up a scientific coding environment

In this lesson, we'll set up
an environment for scientific coding that you can use in CoCo
and beyond.

*Primary goals:*

1. Login to a JupyterHub
1. Get familiar with JupyterLab
1. Use a Jupyter Notebook
1. Open a terminal and use basic shell commands

*Stretch goals (if we have time):*

* Anaconda and `conda`
* Text editors and integrated development environments (IDEs)


## Topics

1. [Project Jupyter](./jupyter.md): JupyterHub, JupyterLab, and Jupyter Notebook
1. [The terminal and shell commands](./shell-intro.md)


## Further reading

See the lists of resources at the end of each of the topics listed above.


## Homework

* Read about Jupyter Notebook
* Make a short Jupyter Notebook that includes Python code and Markdown text
* Skim over the Software Carpentry shell lesson ([English](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/), [Spanish](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice-es/))

These are open-ended assignments;
you can do as little or as much as you'd like,
you will not be graded.
The important thing is to try these--they are tools we'll be using through CoCo,
so the work you put in now will pay off later!
